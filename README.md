## Instructions
### Part 1:

### Part 2:


### Add `Save Movie` funcitonality.

You will notice there is a 'Saved Movies' component that we are not currently using. In this step you will add the functionality to save a movie. You will need to pass the `addToSavedList` function to the `Movie` component. Once you have done that you will need to add a click handler to the save button.

### Turn your Saved Movie list into `Link`s.

You will need to uncomment lines 29-39 in `Movie.js` to complete this. Your list of saved movies should be links to the movie itself. Study and understand what the `saveMovie` function is doing.

### Turn your Saved Movie `Link`s into `NavLink`s.
